If your Dell computer does not turn on or boot into the operating system, it is recommended that you first perform a hard reset. Performing a hard reset fixes many problems and also drains residual power that may be causing the problem.

## Why is my Dell laptop plugged in but not turning on?

If your laptop won't turn on even when it is plugged in, there may be a faulty power supply or battery. Make sure the power cord is plugged into an outlet and check the battery to ensure the connection isn't loose.

## How to Fix a Dell Laptop That's Not Working

* Check the power supply. If none of the lights on your PC turn on when you press the power button, even when it's plugged into the wall, then you likely need to replace the power supply. Even if the charging light comes on when you plug in your computer, the cable could still be damaged, so check the power supply unit with a multimeter if you have one.

* Remove any USB storage devices. Your computer could be trying to boot from the wrong drive. If this fixes the problem, change the boot order to ensure your hard drive is at the top of the list.

* Power cycle your Dell laptop. With the computer turned off and unplugged, remove any external devices (USB drives, printers, etc.), then hold down the power button for 15-20 seconds. It will drain any residual power. Next, reconnect the charger and see if your PC powers on.

* Remove the battery. If the charging light comes on, but your PC still won't turn on at all, there could be a problem with the battery. Newer Dell laptops don't have a removable battery, but you can replace them yourself if yours does.

* Run the Dell PC diagnostic tool. Dell computers have a built-in tool that can identify problems when your PC powers on but fails to boot up successfully. It may not automatically fix the issue, but it may give you an error code that can point you in the right direction.

* Boot into Windows Safe Mode. If your PC powers on but doesn't boot into Windows, try starting in Safe Mode. From there, you can scan for viruses and delete programs that can be causing startup issues.

* Remove malware from your Dell laptop. Viruses and other types of malware can cause your PC to freeze at startup. Boot your PC into safe mode if possible and run antivirus software to check for security threats.

* Reset the system BIOS. Clear the CMOS to reset your motherboard's BIOS settings. The system BIOS is the first piece of software your computer must run when it turns on, so restoring it to the default settings could fix booting issues.

* Contact Dell customer support. Visit Dell's support page and search for your laptop model for more specific guidance. If your laptop is still under warranty, it may qualify for a free repair or replacement.

* Factory reset your PC. If your PC powers on but still won't start up correctly, the nuclear option is a factory reset. It will install a clean version of Windows, returning your computer to the state it was in when you first bought it.
